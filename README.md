# QGIS_Ready_Maki_Icons
Maki icons that can be styled in QGIS
These styles are derived from the Maki icons created here - https://labs.mapbox.com/maki-icons/
Simply put attribution has been added to the SVG allowing QGIS to render the fill and stroke colours.

Created using the powershell script - https://github.com/Drewfore/QGIS_Ready_Maki_Icon_Creator
